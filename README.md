# Evacuation

This is the final project of the M2 subject entitled "Modeling and Simulation of Complex system", taught by Prof. Alexis Drogoul.

This project implements a simulation model of different informing strategies about the tsunami threat in [GAMA platform](https://gama-platform.org/). This model is to answer the question:

**How to better manage the pedestrian evacuation of a population on a beach
in a tsunami context?**
